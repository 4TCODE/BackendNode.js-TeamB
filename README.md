# Magic Movers ðŸš€

## About

In the world of Magic Transporters, there are special people known as Magic
Movers. They use nifty gadgets to move important things. Fueled by virtual magic,
these Movers go on quick missions to carry items around.

## Logic

* We need to create magic items
* We need to create magic mover(s) **(done state)**
  * We can start loading the mover: **(loading state)**
    * We can unload the mover **(done state)**
    * We can start the mission **(in a mission state)**
      * We can end the mission **(done state)**
  * We can put the mover in resting state only if it was in *'done state'* **(resting state)**
* We can get all missions and their information

## Used Technology

* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* TypeOrm

## Setup

1- We need a Postgresql database (if you don't have it click : [Here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/))

2- Please Follow / Edit the 'src/config/database.ts' folder.

3- Now we are ready for the next steps:

  ```

* Install dependencies and Run

  ```bash
